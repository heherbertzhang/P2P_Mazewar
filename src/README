to clean: make clean

then run Naming Server: java NamingServer <port#>
then add one client: java Mazewar <Naming Server Host Ip> <Naming server port #> <self port #>
then a window will ask your name and then the game will start

then we can dynamically join new other player by calling: java Mazewar <Naming Server Host Ip> <Naming server port #> <self port #> 
notice this new player should have different name. If on same computer, should have different port number as well.

then can dynamically join more.
